## License

This is an open source [LGPL 2.1](LICENSE.md) licensed project. It uses the following open source projects:

- [TouchVG](https://github.com/touchvg/vgios) (LGPL): Vector drawing framework for iOS.
- [TouchVGCore](https://github.com/touchvg/vgcore) (LGPL): Cross-platform vector drawing libraries using C++.
- [SVGKit](https://github.com/SVGKit/SVGKit) (MIT): Display and interact with SVG Images with CoreAnimation on iOS.
- [DemoCmds](https://github.com/touchvg/DemoCmds): A template and example project containing customized shape and command classes.

## How to Compile

- Cd the folder of this project and type `./build.sh` or `./build.sh -arch arm64` to checkout and build libraries needed.

- Open `tests/TestVG.xcworkspace` in Xcode, then run the `TestView` demo app.
   
   - `TestView` target using `libTouchVG.a` does not support SVG display.

   - `TestView-SVG` target using `libTouchVG-SVG.a` and `SVGKit` can display SVG shapes.

   - To run on device, you may need to change the Bundle Identifier of the demo application, such as "com.yourcompany.TestView", and choose your own development certificate (Code Signing).
 
## Add more shapes and commands

- Do not want to write C++ code? Please reference to [test/src/vgtest/testview/shape](test/src/vgtest/testview/shape) package to write your own shape and command classes.

- You can create library project containing your own shapes and commands. So the TouchVG and TouchVGCore libraries does not require changes.

  - Checkout and enter [DemoCmds](https://github.com/touchvg/DemoCmds) directory, then type `python newproj.py YourCmds`:

     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/touchvg/DemoCmds.git
     cd DemoCmds
     python newproj.py MyCmds
     ```

- You can customize the drawing behavior via implement your CmdObserver class (see the example in [DemoCmds](https://github.com/touchvg/DemoCmds) ).
